# tensorFlowTest

*Let's learn [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) together!*

## What is this repo'?'

I'm learning TensorFlow and making examples so others can learn from me! Hopefully it can be helpful for people getting into Machine Learning.

## Getting started

### Windows

This repository is intended to be used with Windows, if you're new to Python/Tensorflow/Git and don't yet have a development environment set up,
run the [*CreateEnvironment.ps1*](https://github.com/soda3x/tensorFlowTest/blob/master/CreateEnvironment.ps1) script with Powershell to grab everything you need, it'll even clone this repository!

### Ubuntu

If you're not on Windows, I plan on making a version of this script that will do the same for [*Ubuntu*](https://github.com/soda3x/tensorFlowTest/issues/20).
For now, you can still use the files in this repository without the script!

### MacOS

I'll do a [*MacOS*](https://github.com/soda3x/tensorFlowTest/issues/21) version eventually but I currently do not own a Mac. If you have a Mac, you can still use the files in this repository!
